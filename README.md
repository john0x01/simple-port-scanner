# simple-port-scanner
Simple python portscanner made using **sockets** library that sets a TCP/IP client and connects it to each port listed (21, 23, 80, 443, 8080) of the given URL to find out if there are any services running on that specific port (OPEN) <br>
This is my 1st time using this library
